# Migrating from 1.* to 2.*

## How to Read This Guide

This guide is intended to help you migrate existing functionality from `that-depends` version `1.*` to `2.*`.  
The goal is to enable you to migrate as quickly as possible while making only the minimal necessary changes to your codebase.

If you want to learn more about the new features introduced in `2.*`, please refer to the [documentation](https://that-depends.readthedocs.io/) and the [release notes](https://github.com/modern-python/that-depends/releases).

## Deprecated Features

1. **`BaseContainer.init_async_resources()` removed**  
   The method `BaseContainer.init_async_resources()` has been removed. Use `BaseContainer.init_resources()` instead.

   **Example:**  
   If you are using containers, your setup might look like this:

   ```python
   from that_depends import BaseContainer

   class MyContainer(BaseContainer):
       # Define your providers here
       ...
   ```
   Replace all instances of:
   ```python
   await MyContainer.init_async_resources()
   ```
   With:
   ```python
   await MyContainer.init_resources()
   ```

2. **`that_depends.providers.AsyncResource` removed**

   The `AsyncResource` class has been removed. Use `providers.Resource` instead.

   **Example:**  
   Replace all instances of:
   ```python
   from that_depends.providers import AsyncResource
   my_provider = providers.AsyncResource(some_async_function)
   ```
   With:
   ```python
   from that_depends.providers import Resource
   my_provider = providers.Resource(some_async_function)
   ```

## Changes in the API

1. **`container_context()` now requires a keyword argument for initial Context**  
   Previously, a global context could be initialized by passing a dictionary to the `container_context()` context manager:

   ```python
   my_global_context = {"some_key": "some_value"}
   async with container_context(my_global_context):
       assert fetch_context_item("some_key") == "some_value"
   ```

   In `2.*`, use the `global_context` keyword argument instead:

   ```python
   my_global_context = {"some_key": "some_value"}
   async with container_context(global_context=my_global_context):
       assert fetch_context_item("some_key") == "some_value"
   ```

2. **Context reset behavior changed in `container_context()`**  
   Previously, calling `container_context(my_global_context)` would:
   - Set the global context to `my_global_context`, allowing values to be resolved using `fetch_context_item()`. This behavior remains the same.
   - Reset the context for all `providers.ContextResource` instances globally. This behavior has changed.

   In `2.*`, if you want to reset the context for all resources in addition to setting a global context, you need to use the `reset_all_containers=True` argument:

   ```python
   async with container_context(global_context=my_global_context, reset_all_containers=True):
       assert fetch_context_item("some_key") == "some_value"
   ```

   > **Note:** `reset_all_containers=True` only reinitializes the context for `ContextResource` instances defined within containers (i.e., classes inheriting from `BaseContainer`). If you also need to reset contexts for resources defined outside containers, you must handle these explicitly. See the [ContextResource documentation](../providers/context-resources.md) for more details.

3. **Container classes now require you to define `default_scope`**

    In `2.*`, you must define the `default_scope` attribute in your container classes if you plan to define any `ContextResource` providers in that class. This attribute specifies the default scope for all `ContextResource` providers defined within the container.
    
    **Example:**
    
    ```python
    from that_depends import BaseContainer, providers
   
    class MyContainer(BaseContainer):
        default_scope = None # This will maintain compatibility with 1.*
        p = providers.ContextResource(my_resource)
   ```
   Setting the value of `default_context = None` maintains the same behaviours as in `1.*`. Please look at the [scopes Documentation](../introduction/scopes.md).

## Potential Issues with `container_context()`

If you have migrated the functionality as described above but still experience issues managing context resources, it might be due to improperly initializing resources when entering `container_context()`.

Here’s an example of an incompatibility with `1.*`:

```python
from that_depends import container_context

async def some_async_function():
    # Enter a new context but import `MyContainer` later
    async with container_context():
        from some_other_module import MyContainer
        # Attempt to resolve a `ContextResource` resource
        my_resource = await MyContainer.my_context_resource.async_resolve()  # ❌ Error!
```

To resolve such issues in `2.*`, consider the following suggestions:

1. **Pass explicit arguments to `DIContextMiddleware`**  
   If you are using `DIContextMiddleware` with your ASGI application, you can now pass additional arguments.

   **Example with `FastAPI`:**

   ```python
   import fastapi
   from that_depends.providers import DIContextMiddleware, ContextResource
   from that_depends import BaseContainer

   MyContainer: BaseContainer
   my_context_resource_provider: ContextResource
   my_app: fastapi.FastAPI

   my_app.add_middleware(DIContextMiddleware, MyContainer, my_context_resource_provider)
   ```

   This middleware will automatically initialize the context for the provided resources when an endpoint is called.

2. **Avoid entering `container_context()` without arguments**  
   Pass all resources supporting context initialization (e.g., `providers.ContextResource` instances and `BaseContainer` subclasses) explicitly.

   **Example:**

   ```python
   from that_depends import container_context

   MyContainer: BaseContainer
   my_context_resource_provider: ContextResource

   async with container_context(MyContainer, my_context_resource_provider):
       # Resolve resources
       my_container_instance = MyContainer.my_context_resource.sync_resolve()
       my_provider_instance = my_context_resource_provider.sync_resolve()
   ```

   Explicit initialization of container context is recommended to prevent unexpected behavior and improve performance.
